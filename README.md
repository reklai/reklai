**** Reece here,

**Software Developer | USAF | Backend Enthusiast | Systems Tinkerer**

I'm a Computer Science grad currently serving in the U.S. Air Force, building software that solves real problems — from Raspberry Pi camera systems on cargo vehicles to backend APIs in Go. I love optimizing systems, diving deep into infrastructure, and making things work *efficiently*.
